<H1>Hobby #2: Writing</H1>

<h2> Description </h2>

<p> 
    I think my favorite thing to write is a poem, even though I don't write them very often. There's something meditative about letting go of strict, logical and rational mental schema and trying to convey a feeling or experience in a more abstract way.
</p>

<p>
    I keep a journal where I write something about what I did and what my thoughts were every day.
